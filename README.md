# Hi, I'm Mohamed 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻

I'm an iOS Software Engineer with a passion for building intuitive, high-performance mobile apps. My focus is on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code that ensures exceptional user experiences.

🚀 I'm also deeply interested in AI, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs). Currently exploring the potential of Google Cloud, Vertex AI, and generative AI to push the boundaries of what's possible in iOS development.

💡 I love solving challenging problems and staying ahead of the curve by continuously learning and experimenting with new technologies. Feel free to explore my projects and connect if you'd like to collaborate!
